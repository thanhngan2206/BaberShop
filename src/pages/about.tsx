            Like every good story, this one starts in an alley. With two men in love with barbering. Sotted in style. And drowning under the influences of rock â€˜n roll, kustom culture and the working
            class ethic of Rotterdam.

            Leen and Bertus wanted to cut every man the perfect hairstyle, proper porkchop. And to provide a haven. A barbershop. A place men could trust the products and enjoy the company. Those
